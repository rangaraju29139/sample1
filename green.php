This rating, on a scale of 60â€“99, provides a comprehensive measure of a school's performance as an environmentally aware and prepared institution. Specifically, it includes 1) whether students have a campus quality of life that is both healthy and sustainable, 2) how well a school is preparing students for employment in the clean-energy economy of the 21st century as well as for citizenship in a world now defined by environmental concerns and opportunities and 3) how environmentally responsible a school's policies are.<!--

Additionally, The Princeton Review, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) and Sierra magazine have collaborated on an effort to streamline the reporting process for institutions that choose to participate in various higher education sustainability assessments. The intent of this initiative is to reduce and streamline the amount of time campus staff spend tracking sustainability data and completing related surveys.

To address this issue, these four groups have worked to establish the Campus Sustainability Data Collector (CSDC). The CSDC is based on the STARS Reporting Tool and is available for all schools (free of charge) that would like to submit data to these groups in one single survey.Please find more information here: https://www.princetonreview.com/green-data-partnership.

We asked all the schools we annually collect data from to answer questions about their efforts to provide (and continually develop) an environmentally beneficial student experience. The questions were created in consultation with ecoAmerica, a research- and partnership-based environmental nonprofit that convened an expert committee to design this comprehensive ranking system. Colleges that did not supply answers to a sufficient number of the questions for us to fairly compare them to other schools received a Green Rating of 60*. The schools have an opportunity to update their sustainability data every year and will have their ratings recalculated and published annually.

Questions it covers include:<br>

What is the percentage of food expenditures that goes toward local, organic or otherwise environmentally preferable food?
<br>
Does the school offer programs including mass transit programs, bike sharing, facilities for bicyclists, bicycle and pedestrian plans, car sharing, a carpool discount, carpool/vanpool matching, cash-out of parking, prohibiting idling, local housing, telecommuting, and a condensed workweek?<br>
Does the school have a formal committee with participation from students that is devoted to advancing sustainability on campus?<br>
Are school buildings that were constructed or underwent major renovations in the past three years LEED certified?<br>
What is a school's overall waste-diversion rate?<br>
Does the school have an environmental studies major, minor or concentration?<br>
Do the school's students graduate from programs that include sustainability as a required learning outcome or include multiple sustainability learning outcomes?<br>
Does the school have a formal plan to mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions?<br>
What percentage of the school's energy consumption is derived from renewable resources?<br>
Does the school employ a dedicated full-time (or full-time equivalent) sustainability officer?	<br>-->
