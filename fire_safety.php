          <h2> Fire Safety</h2>
          <p>
		     This rating measures how well prepared a school is to prevent or respond to campus fires, on a scale of 60â€“99.<br>
			 
			 We asked all the schools we annually collect data from to answer several questions about their efforts to ensure fire safety for campus residents. We developed the questions in consultation with the Center for Campus Fire Safety (www.campusfiresafety.org), a nonprofit organization devoted to reducing the loss of life from fire at our nation's campuses.<br> 

<!--<h3>The questions cover:</h3><br>

1) The percentage of student housing sleeping rooms protected by an automatic fire sprinkler system with a fire sprinkler head located in the individual sleeping rooms.<br>

2) The percentage of student housing sleeping rooms equipped with a smoke detector connected to a supervised fire alarm system.<br>

3) The number of malicious fire alarms that occur in student housing per year.<br>

4) The number of unwanted fire alarms that occur in student housing per year.<br>

5) The banning of certain hazardous items and activities in residence halls, like candles, smoking, halogen lamps, etc.<br>

6) The percentage of student housing building fire alarm systems that, if activated, result in a signal being transmitted to a monitored location on campus or the fire department.

Colleges that did not supply answers to a sufficient number of these safety questions for us to fairly compare them to other colleges receive a Fire Safety Rating of 60* (sixty with an asterisk). The schools have an opportunity to update their fire safety data every year and will have their fire safety ratings recalculated and published annually.<br>
