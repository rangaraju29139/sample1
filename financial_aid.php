          <h2>Financial Aid</h2>
          <p>
		     This rating measures how much financial aid a school awards and how satisfied students are with that aid, on a scale of 60â€“99. This rating is based on school-reported data on the percentage of students who were determined to have need and received aid, the percentage of need met for those students, and the percentage of students whose need was fully met. Student survey data that measures students' satisfaction with the financial aid they receive is also considered. Please note that if a school has a Financial Aid Rating of 60* (sixty with an asterisk), it means that the school did not report to us all of the statistics that go into the rating by our deadline.
